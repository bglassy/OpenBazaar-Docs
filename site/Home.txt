**OpenBazaar** is a new way to buy and sell goods and services online. By running a program on your computer, you can connect directly to other users in the OpenBazaar network and trade with them. The network isn't controlled by a company or organisation. OpenBazaar is a BitTorrent-style peer-to-peer network. This means there are **no mandatory fees to pay** and the network is _censorship-resistant_.

Goods and services are bought and sold on OpenBazaar using **Bitcoin**, a digital cryptocurrency that is decentralized and censorship-resistant. Transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are typically a fraction of a cent. 

**Bitcoin and OpenBazaar together are the future on online commerce.**

This project is open source, which means the code is publicly available, can be reviewed, and anyone can join the project and suggest changes. We are always looking for more support, whether through developer contributions or financial donations.
